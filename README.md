# Salako_Malunas
Project for learning purposes
The purpose of this project is to create a fully working website for a real magical place in Salakas village - an old mill which was recently transformed into photo studio.
Website should contain some historical information, photos, contact details and upcoming events. 
It was built using basically html and css but will be enhanced with some javascript along the way.
